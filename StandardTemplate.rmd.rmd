# Introduction

<In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?>

#### what was asked for
Investigate whether the odors from a predator might influence the defensive behavior of Hadrurus arizonensis, and if the scorpion size plays a role in the type of response.

we see this as two questions

##### does presence of odor change the expected outcome on our measurements?

<for continuous measurements we could ask for center differences (means or medians)

for catagorical explanitory variables (such as count of type of response)
a chi-squared test would be chosen.>

# Methods for presence vs absence of odor

<Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.>

#Results

<Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.>

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question>

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question>

## Inferential Results

<State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question>

# Methods for different sizes (large vs small)

<Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.>

# Discussion and Conclusion for both set of research questions

<Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.>
